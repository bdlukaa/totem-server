        "content": "## Keeper Script Example\n\n_Here’s an example script on how a Keeper could decide to run their Circle! This is NOT written in stone, in fact it is open for interpretation, and we encourage you to bring your own personality to your Keeper style. People want to see you for who you are, and this will be reflected in your prompts and how you answer them. Have fun with it!  _\n**Welcome _(Greet participants as they arrive)_**\n\nOnce everyone has arrived in the Waiting room the Keeper can alert everyone that you will begin the Circle. Press **START **if using the Totem app.\n\n**Keeper: **Welcome everyone! For those of you who are Circle newcomers I will explain briefly what to expect.\n\nCircle is a confidential, safe space where everyone is invited to share and listen to one another. We will begin with a short stretch and breathing exercise to get us warmed up, and then I will present a series of questions to the group, answering the questions one at a time as they relate to you. When you are finished speaking, you may pass to the next person.\n\nThere are only a few rules while in Circle. Speak from your experience only, meaning use “I” statements rather than “you” statements. We are here to practice sharing from the heart and putting our individual emotions, thoughts, experiences into words.\n\nIf someone does say something that you would like to comment on, relate it to your own experience. Try saying “When Lindsay said this it made me think of when I…” Remember we are here to share our own thoughts and no one else's. This is a time to listen to others perspectives and speak about your own experience, uninterrupted.\n\nThe other rule is that only one person speaks at a time. When it is your turn you may speak uninterrupted until you are finished. You may also pass if you do not wish to share. Be mindful that everyone must also answer the prompt as well but unlike a conversation, we do not need to comment on other’s shares. When you are finished you may pass to the next person.\n\nAs a Keeper, I will also be answering the prompts as they relate to myself. We are all equals in the Circle, the Keeper can be thought of as a group moderator, but also shares like everyone else.\n\nAny questions before we begin?\n## Opening Ceremony Ideas\n\n_[Click here for more extensive Opening Ceremony Ideas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Db-PbKDIBB1b0UynYN4fyPth5gMWG3zNf_XluUYTrLo/edit?usp=sharing)_\n\n**_Guided Stretch _**\n\n**Keeper:** I’d like to start with a few group stretches. Slowly roll your head around on your neck clockwise in a complete circle. Let’s repeat four times. Now let’s roll in the opposite direction. Repeat four times.\n\nRaise both your arms above your head, reaching to full extension. Take your right hand and grab your left wrist, lean into your left side. Switch, take your left hand and grab your right wrist, leaning into your right side.\n\nWrinkle up the muscles of your face like a walnut: forehead wrinkled, eyes squinted, lips pursed, and shoulders hunched. Hold. Now open your eyes and mouth wide to full extension. (Repeat 4x)\n\nArch your shoulders back as you take a deep breath into your chest. Hold. Relax. Take a deep breath, pushing out your stomach. Hold. Relax.  (Repeat 4x)\n\nStraighten your legs and point your toes back toward your face, tightening your shins. Hold. Relax. (Repeat 4x)\n\nStraighten your legs and curl your toes, simultaneously tightening your calves, thighs, and glutes. Relax.\n\n**_Guided Breathing Exercise_**\n\n**Keeper: **Everyone close your eyes, get in a comfortable position and take a deep breath in through your nose, out through your mouth. Let’s do that a few more times.\n\nNext let’s take a big deep breath in and hold for 5…4…3…2…1. And exhale for 5…4…3…2…1. Let’s repeat that a few more times.\n\nHold up your thumb and index fingers and place your thumb on one nostril. Take a deep breath in, and exhale through the same nostril. Then switch. Place your index finger over the opposite nostril and breathe in, and exhale. (Repeat 4x) By doing this breathing on separate sides you are allowing full oxygen into both sides of your brain.\n\nNow you may open your eyes. Let’s begin!\n\n**_Guided Meditation (Mindfulness Meditation Script)_**\n\n**Keeper: **Take a big breath in and out\n\nClose your eyes if that feels safe and available today\n\nEnvision yourself sitting along a river\n\nThe sun is kissing your face and the breeze flows\n\nThe day is perfect, neither too hot nor cold\n\nAllow yourself to be fully present and safe in this space\n\nLet your breath be natural, flowing in and out\n\nAs you breathe in and out, thoughts will flow into your conscious naturally\n\nAs they do, visualize yourself placing them in a small paper boat and floating down the river\n\nContinue this process in your breath, mind, and body\n\nBe careful not to pass judgment as thoughts arise\n\nJust simply release them out to the river\n\n(After a few minutes of silence)\n\nSlowly bring awareness back into your body\n\nWiggling your toes and fingers\n\nAnd finally opening your eyes\n\n**_Guided meditation #2 _**\n\nLet's begin by taking a moment to allow your body to settle into a comfortable position (2 seconds).\n\nYou may close your eyes or keep them slightly open allowing the spine to lift (2 seconds)\n\nthe shoulders to soften (5 seconds).\n\nToday we will practice a body scan (5 seconds).\n\nTaking a full breath in (2 seconds)\n\nand a long breath out (10 seconds).\n\nBegin by bringing your attention into your body (5 seconds).\n\nNotice the feeling of the weight of your body on the chair, or the floor,\n\nwherever you are (10 seconds).\n\nAnd as you breathe notice how your chest and abdomen expand\n\nto allow the air to enter your lungs (5 seconds).\n\nWhat sensations are you aware of? (5 seconds)\n\nAnd as you exhale bring awareness to the stillness\n\nand notice the sense of relaxing more deeply (20 seconds)\n\nNow bring your attention to the top of your head,\n\nnoticing any sensations in the scalp (2 seconds),\n\ndown the back of the head (2 seconds),\n\nto the sides (2 seconds), to the face (2 seconds).\n\nNotice your jaw (2 seconds) if you're holding any tension in your jaw (2 seconds).\n\nLet your face be soft (2 seconds)\n\nrelax the muscles around your eyes and your mouth (5 seconds).\n\nBreathing in (2 seconds)\n\nbreathing out (20 seconds).\n\nNow notice your neck and your throat (2 seconds).\n\nLet them be soft (10 seconds)\n\nNotice your shoulders and arms,\n\nfeel any sensations as you allow your tension to move from your shoulders\n\ndown to your upper arms, the elbow, to your forearms, wrists, hands, and fingers (15 seconds).\n## Opener Question\n\n**Keeper: **Now let’s begin. For the opening question, I almost always choose something a bit lighter to get us warmed up. One of my favorite questions is “What is something that brought you joy this week?” I love this question because it helps me to recall an instance that I can reflect on, and how it helps me to have more joy in my life. It also helps me to express gratitude for something or someone. One thing that happened to me this week was spending time with my friend _____ because…. (continues share)\n\n…And that’s something that brought me joy this week. So I’d like to hear from you all - What’s something that brought you joy this week? When it’s your turn, come off-mute and when you’re finished sharing pass to the next person in the talking order. I’ll pass to ______.\n## Prompt #1\n\n**Keeper: **Thank you everyone for sharing. I would like to remind everyone to speak from your own experience, meaning rather than using general statements like “you always need…” try using “I” statements, speaking only what applies to yourself.. Also remember while there is technically no time limit for your share, remember that we only have an hour together and that everyone must have an equal opportunity to speak.\n\nFor the next prompt I’d like to ask everyone something a little more challenging perhaps. “What is something in your life that you’d like to let go of?” I chose this question because I feel like there is always something that I find holds me back at times because…. (continues share)\n\n_Continues to next few prompts_\n## Closing Prompt\n\n**Keeper: **Now that we are getting close to the Circle coming to an end, I’d like to go around one last time and ask “Is there anything you need to say before the Circle closes?” I like this question because it allows everyone to say what they need to say, if anything and we can all have some closure before we meet again the next time. I would just like to thank you all for being here and express my gratitude for being able to listen to all of your shares, and you all being receptive with my own shares…. (continues share)\n## Closing Ceremony\n\n_[Click here for more extensive Closing Ceremony Ideas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Db-PbKDIBB1b0UynYN4fyPth5gMWG3zNf_XluUYTrLo/edit?usp=sharing)_\n\n**Keeper: **I would like to close our Circle today with a short poem. _The 3 Gates of Speech by Rumi_\n    _Before you speak, let your words pass through three gates:_\n        _At the first gate, ask yourself “Is is true?”_\n        _At the second gate ask, “Is it necessary?”_\n        _At the third gate ask, “Is it kind?”_\n\nI’d like to thank you all for coming today, and I look forward to seeing you all next time.

        "content": "## Introduction\n\nWelcome to the Totem training guide for prospective Circle Keepers! The following sections offer explanations including: understanding Circles, actualizing a Circle with Trainer and Trainee, and conducting a Circle yourself.\n\nWe are excited to share this experience with you, and we hope that this training guide will inspire you to incorporate Circles into your life. With Circles, you can create a safe and supportive environment to share and learn with others. This can help you to build stronger relationships, build community, develop new skills, and personally grow.\n\n_Let’s get started!_\n\n## Totem Mission\n\nThe mission of Totem is to unite people from all walks of life by collective sharing and mutual understanding through the practice of Circles. It is our belief that by making Circles more widely available we allow for a more thoughtful and caring world. We hope that participants, such as yourself, may gain the ability to work through various problems in their lives by developing a greater understanding of themselves through this enriching practice.\n\n## Why Circle?\n\nCircle uses a specific structure where participants may benefit from personal growth in a variety of ways including but not limited to:\n\n1.  The freedom to speak your truth\n\n2.  Practice vulnerability and presence\n\n3.  Reveal your deepest secrets in a safe space\n\n4.  Acknowledge your mistakes and fears\n\n5.  Express your core values\n\n6.  Navigate through various emotions into shared experience with others\n\n7.  A platform to share, uninterrupted\n\nThese are just a few of the benefits that people can gain from participating in Circle. By providing a space where people can not only share these thoughts and feelings, but also listen to others experiences, they can grow to a better understanding of themselves and others.\n\n# What is Circle?\n\nCircle, inspired by Native North-American tribal traditions, is an alternative communication method that facilitates dialogue in a group setting. Participants take turns sharing their thoughts in response to prompts presented by the Circle Keeper, fostering an open and inclusive environment.\n## Group therapy?\n\nAre you curious about Circle and wondering how it compares to group therapy? Let us explain! While Circle shares some similarities with group therapy, its unique approach sets it apart.\n\nOne of the biggest differences is that Circle does not require a licensed clinician or psychotherapist to moderate the meetings. Instead, the group is led by a Keeper (you!) who is also a participant. This means there is no hierarchy in which only those seeking therapy share details of their lives. In Circle, everyone has the opportunity to share their own experiences related to the prompts.\n\nLet's imagine a Circle focused on the theme of gratitude to give you a better idea of what this looks like in practice. Each participant would have the opportunity to share something they are grateful for, and then the group would discuss how gratitude impacts their lives. For example, one participant may share that they are thankful for their supportive family, and the next participant might share how their community helps them to be grateful for having an enriched life.\n\nIt's important to note that unlike traditional group therapy, the goal of Circle is not to solve a particular issue that a participant may present. Rather, it is to provide a safe and supportive environment for everyone to share their experiences and gain a greater understanding for themselves. So if you're looking for a new way to connect with others and gain insight into yourself, Circle might be just what you're looking for!\n\n## Structure\n\nCircle can be done with as little as two people, preferably more than three and up to eight. There can be larger Circles, but for learning purposes we recommend smaller-sized (3-4 persons) especially when just started out, as they seem easier to manage.\n\nIn short, Circle structure consists of the Keeper leading the group with an Opening Ceremony of their choice, followed by presenting a series of prompts and/or questions over a set period of time, generally around one hour. (Time is decided prior to beginning the Circle).\n\nPrompts and/or questions are presented and then answered one participant at a time. The Keeper ideally answers the question first to model how to share and therefore setting the general tone. Then they pass to the next person in the talking order. When the Circle is nearing completion, the Keeper will do a Closing question to wrap up, followed by a Closing Ceremony of their choice.\n\n## Participants\n\nCircle is made up of participants where everyone is considered equal, with equal opportunities to share.\n## Keeper\n\nThe Keeper leads the Circle by conducting the opening and closing ceremonies, curating prompts or questions throughout the duration of the Circle which are specific to the group. Keepers generally are participants approximately 80% and Keepers 20% of the time. They may also have extra duties to explain to others how to participate if they are new to Circles or need refreshing. They may also have to change plans on the fly in service to the Circle if needed. For example, if the Circle Keeper feels that the group needs another round to answer to the same prompt, they may suggest doing so rather than continuing onto their next planned prompt. Keepers also must keep close watch on time to respect all participants’ schedules and begin the closing ceremony when needed.\n\n## Talking order\n\nThe talking order should be decided prior to beginning the Circle so that all participants may know when it is their turn, and who they will be passing to next. While using the Totem app, participants may see the talking order and who’s turn it is to share next. Sometimes, the Keeper will choose this at random, or they may have a motive involved such as more experienced Circle participants first, followed by less experienced.\n\n# The Participant’s role\n\nEveryone in the Circle is a participant, including the Keeper. The role of each participant in the Circle has a role which is to be present to share and listen. That being said, if a participant would like to pass when it is their turn to share, they are also welcome to. No one is forced to share, or listen for that matter, but rather be present in the Circle.\n\n## Participant’s Responsibilities\n\nThe responsibility of each participant in the Circle is the opportunity to share, listen, and be present. When it’s the participants turn to share, also known as having the talking piece, they can share from their own experience as related to the prompt given by the Keeper. When it is not their turn, it is their responsibility to listen. By sharing your own perspective you can give to yourself and others by processing thoughts and feelings. By listening to others, you can hear different stories to enrich your perspective. To truly reap the benefits of participating in Circle, these responsibilities are encouraged.\n\n## Community Guidelines\n\n1. Respect the privacy of others in Circle\n\n2. Remain open, speak authentically and listen thoroughly\n\n3. Share only from your own lived experience.\n\n4. Refrain from cross-talking, giving advice or diagnosing.\n\n5. Do not use hate speech, engage in hateful conduct or threaten to harm a group of people or individual\n\n6. Only speak when in possession of the talking piece\n\n## Sharing\n\nCircle all comes down to sharing! Circle provides a safe space where participants can share their experiences, thoughts, and emotions; reflecting and expressing themselves from a place of truth. This can also be done by what's known as “moving from head to heart”, which is allowing oneself to be vulnerable, putting emotions into words and being present with yourself.\n\nStrangers may be able to unite when they are allowed to discuss some of the most pressing issues in their life in a safe space. The structure of Circle is minimal in rules but difficult in the work done by sharing honestly. Circle is famously known as “simple but not easy”. Some people have worked decades to master it, but even the most seasoned know it is a life-long journey, and not a game that can be “won”. By sharing in Circle, we come to a place of understanding ourselves and others.\n\n## I statements\n\nAs a Keeper, encourage speaking in “I” statements as opposed to “you” statements, meaning that you only speak about yourself and your own experiences. This can be challenging as many may not be accustomed to expressing in this form, especially when others voice problems in their lives it may be a natural impulse for others to try to help or give advice. Giving advice is not the aim of the Circle.\n\nThe idea behind only speaking from our own experience is because it is the perspective each of us knows as true. By voicing our shares out loud and uninterrupted we are allowed to gain a deeper understanding of ourselves. It is without this interruption that we are able to finish our thoughts without an outside interjection, which may not be the case in other settings.\n\n**Activity**\n\nTrue or False? Check out some of these statements to identify if they are “I” statements:\n\n1. It’s difficult when you have a lot going on in your personal life\n\n2. My hair has been a huge point of contention for me\n\n3. My mom always takes out her anger on me\n\n4. Life always has a way of throwing things at you\n\n5. Healthy self-talk helps when you are spiraling out with anxiety\n\nListening provides opportunities to grow and gain wisdom by understanding each other’s perspectives and vice versa. Indirectly we can help others through problems in their lives by sharing and revealing some of our own most private and pressing issues.\n\n# The Keeper’s role\n\nThe Keeper’s role is in fact to “keep” the Circle together by providing light facilitation among the group. This is accomplished by leading the group through the structure of the Circle and everything it entails. The Keeper also plays an instrumental role in organizing the Circle, from coordinating with participants to curating prompts specific to that particular Circle.\n\n## Responsibilities/Keeper mission\n\nKeepers are excellent Circle participants and have a lifelong passion to work on themselves and improve their overall wellness. Keepers have a special role because they are moderators and therefore allow others to experience Circles, ensuring everything that comes along with it goes smoothly with gentle facilitation. Our hope is that by becoming a Keeper you are not only interested in improving your own mental health but for others as well.\n\n## Keeper guidelines\n\nThe Keeper guidelines are designed to give the optimal experience for themselves and the participants in the Circle. This sounds like a lot, but it’s pretty simple. Remember that you participate just like everyone else. So while you are providing questions and prompts, you are also a peer to everyone. That being said, there are a few things to “keep” in mind while Keeping the Circle.\n\n## Goals\n\n1. __Lead your Circle:__ Be present and follow the structure (Opening, prompts, closing)\n\n2. __Be Specific:__ Select prompts and/or questions that are relevant to your Circle\n\n3. __Be welcoming and kind:__ Treat other participants how you would like to be treated\n\n4. __Maintain oversight:__ Ensure that participants follow Community Guidelines\n\n5. __Step in:__ If conflict should arise you may use your discretion to mediate _(this is rare, but you also have the power if using the app to eject someone if necessary)_\n\n6. __Share:__ Set an example to others by being honest when you are answering prompts\n\n7. __Be responsive:__ Be there for your participants whether in scheduling, answering questions or during Circle.\n\n## Non-Goals\n\n1. __Giving advice:__ Circle is not for giving advice, but for reflecting and sharing.\n\n2. __Being too lead-forward:__ Everyone is equal in Circle and the Keeper should think of leading as “gentle facilitation”.\n\n# Circle with trainer as the Keeper\n\nNow that you have gone over all the different aspects of Circling, you can Circle with your trainer as the Keeper and you as the participant. Even if you have already done a Circle prior to this, it’s important to apply your new knowledge and see how the trainer facilitates their Circle.\n\n## Observation sheet\n\nDuring the Circle with your trainer, utilize the [Observation sheet] to take notes on what you might like to incorporate into your practice. After the Circle is finished, take a few minutes to give some feedback to your trainer on their Circle. This can be anything from questions, likes, dislikes, comments, anything that struck a chord with you.\n\n## Preparing for next week\n\nPlan and prepare your Circle for the next session with your trainer! (see following section “Creating a Circle” for more details) [See prompt repository here]\n\n## Preparation list\n\n+ Opening Ceremony: guided meditation, group stretch, etc.\n\n+ Opening Prompt: Lighter in nature\n\n+ Prompts (we suggest choosing five although you most likely will not go through all of them)\n\n+ Closing Ceremony\n\n## Planning a Circle\n\n+ When planning your Circle, ask yourself what is this Circle for? Is it a general Circle? Is it for a specific group? Knowing what kind of Circle should help guide you to the overall tone and select what kind of prompts that would be appropriate for this Circle.\n\n+ Practice your __Opening Ceremony__. Will it be a guided meditation, body scan, or poem? Ask yourself what is it that I would personally like to do if I was participating in a Circle? Write it out!\n\n+ For a list of prompts see our  [__Prompt Depository__] for some ideas. It is our recommendation to prepare five prompts for an hour-long group. The prompts should range from lighter to heavier in content as to give a variety, usually beginning with a lighter question.\n\n+ [__Sample Script__.] It may be helpful to type out a script going through the different steps in your Circle to allow you to get used to your Circle personal style. How might you explain Circle to someone who has never done it before?\n\n+ __Segues__. For some Keepers or beginning public speakers, planned segues can be very helpful before passing the talking piece to the next person. This can be as simple as explaining out loud that you are passing the talking piece to the next person. Over-explaining what you are actively doing in the moment is supportive to others’ because it guides their learning in the general Circle structure. For example, giving explanation as to why you chose the prompt, followed by restating the prompt allows for people to ready themselves for their turn and reminds them if they were confused or forgot the prompt since your share began.\n\n+ Practice your [__Closing Ceremony__]. This is usually much shorter, but it is good to have an idea of what you’d like to do, even if it's just a few words. Some Keepers decide to close with a poem, a bell, collective bowing. It’s your choice.\n\n# Trainee runs a Circle\n\nNow comes the fun part, you running the Circle as the Keeper! Switching roles is important because it gives perspective for both trainer and trainee to experience how it is to do the opposite role. It also gives insight on what to improve for the next Circle, and allows for time to answer any questions or offer explanations. This should be a minimum of an hour with all participants. After completing the Circle, the Keeper trainer and trainee can assess their comfort level with running the Circle and if they need additional sessions to improve before.\n\n## Breakout rooms\n\nFor larger groups in training, breakout rooms can be a helpful way to give feedback and discuss various topics in the Circle. This gives everyone a chance to discuss the learning process amongst your colleagues and get helpful feedback.\n\n# Appendix\n\n## In Person Circles\n\nIn-Person Circles are a great way to practice as they are the original way that people have conducted them for hundreds of years. It is a great way to experience because they present a different set of advantages and disadvantages than virtual Circles. If you have the opportunity to practice an in-person Circle, we highly recommend this!\n\n### Choose a place\n\nFinding a comfortable place is important for your in-person Circle. Choose a place that can comfortably accommodate the number of people in attendance, hopefully that is also quiet so everyone can be undisturbed by any outside distractions while sharing and listening. Once everyone has arrived, have them sit in a Circle! This creates an easy way to pass the talking piece.\n\n### Ambience: Centerpiece and Talking piece\n\nSetting the ambience can be a great way to welcome others to your Circle. Creating a relaxing ambience makes it easier for you and your participants to share easily with each other. This can be something as simple as low lighting, cushions or pillow to sit on, tapestries, really anything that makes you feel at home.\n\nCenterpieces can be another way to add comfort and ambience to your Circle, something that goes in - you guessed it - the center of the Circle! This can be a candle, a figure of your choice, flowers, anything that gives people something nice to look at while in the Circle.\n\nThe talking piece is very important during in-person Circles as it is the object that tells everyone who’s turn it is to speak. When choosing a talking piece, make sure it is something that can be held in your hand such as a small rock or something with a story behind it. Some Keepers will choose an object that has a nice texture because it allows participants to share easily when they have something to occupy their hands.\n\n## Online Circles\n\n### Zoom Instructions\n\n1.

Be sure to greet everyone as they arrive. While everyone is off-mute the Keeper may ask if there is anyone who has not participated in Circle before and if so, give a brief explanation of what will happen once the Circle begins and how to share.\n\n8. Once everyone has arrived, the Keeper will press __START__ to begin the Circle. Before starting, make sure everyone knows that when it is their turn to share they will not see themselves as to not distract from their share - they will see the other participants. To begin sharing, participants will select __Receive Totem__. To pass to the next person they will toggle left to right __Slide to Pass__ at the bottom of the screen.\n\n9. __Opening Ceremony:__ The Keeper begins with an opening ceremony of their choice.

Naturally in an online setting this changes, but the talking order reflects it in that the talking piece comes around and repeats the talking order circularly. The ceremony consists of the Circle Keeper leading the group through the Check-in, various prompts, check out and closing.\n\n* **Talking piece:** Also referred to as the Totem, the talking piece is passed from one person to the next in the Circle, providing only the person holding it the power to speak and receiving everyone's attention. In an online setting there is no physical talking piece, but when it is the participants turn they are given the same privileges to speak as if they were holding the talking piece. This ensures mutual respect between speakers and listeners.\n\n* **Keeper:** Leads the Circle by conducting the opening and closing ceremonies, curating prompts or questions throughout the duration of the Circle which are specific to the group. Keepers generally are participants approximately 80% and Keepers 20% of the time. They may also have extra duties to explain to others how to participate if they are new to Circles or need refreshing. They may also have to change plans on the fly in service to the Circle if needed. For example, if the Circle Keeper feels that the group needs another round to answer to the same prompt, they may suggest doing so rather than continuing onto their next planned prompt. Keepers also must keep close watch on time to respect all participants’ schedules and begin the closing ceremony when needed.\n\n* **Guidelines:** For more regular Circles, Guidelines may be implemented. Guidelines allow for participants to show respect for one another by sharing their values in the Circle. Guidelines are done by everyone stating their specific wants, needs, and values during Circle. This can help to ensure safety, comfort level, etc. Example: “I need confidentiality” or “you can't share anything you thought about during someone else's share”. The Keeper may then ask each member what that means to them so that there is a collective agreement moving forward. Once everyone has agreed unanimously to the inputted Guidelines they must be followed accordingly in the Circle.\n\n* **Consensus:** Once the Guidelines have been submitted, everyone must agree to all the inputted Guidelines, meaning it is not decided democratically. The reason for this is it is impertinent that all members are heard because it will create a rift in the group if we do not have agreement on all the Guidelines. All group decisions are made by consensus.\n\n* **Waiting Room:** Area where all participants meet before the Circle begins. As the Keeper, you will greet everyone as they arrive. Once all guests have arrived you may begin the Circle where everyone now remains muted until it is their turn. The waiting room is the time when everyone can be off-mute.",
