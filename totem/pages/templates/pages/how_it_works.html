    <h1>How Totem Works</h1>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      Totem is a modern take on the tradition of Healing Circles. We aim to
      address our collective need for support and connection. Totem's circles
      provide a community-based approach to self-discovery and growth. Totem is
      social healing.
    </p>
    <p>
      While participating in circle, you are welcome to share as many or as few
      details as you are comfortable with, we only ask that you share
      authentically.
    </p>
    <h2>Structure</h2>
    <p>
      Our Circles have 3-8 participants, with a Circle Keeper guiding the group and
      maintaining a safe environment. The Keeper starts with an opener, then
      shares the first prompt and their response, passing the talking piece
      (totem) to the next person. Participants can share or pass when it's their
      turn. Keepers may add more prompts as needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Circles can last up to 1.5 hours. Before ending, the totem is passed around
      for final thoughts. The Keeper then closes the circle, releasing everyone back to
      their daily lives.

          Our ancestors gathered around a fire in a circle. Families gather around
          the kitchen table in a circle. Now, we are learning to gather in a
          circle as a community to solve problems, support one another, and
          connect to one another.
