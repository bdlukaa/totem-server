These Terms govern your access to and use of any products or services offered by us, whether on [totem.org](https://www.totem.org), or otherwise (the **"Services"**).

Please read these Terms carefully.

If you are using the Services on behalf of an entity, you are agreeing to these Terms for that entity and are representing to us that you have the authority to bind that entity to these Terms (in which case **"you"** will refer to that entity). If you do not accept these Terms or do not satisfy the eligibility requirements set forth below, you may not access or use the Services.

**Privacy Policy**

Your use of, and participation in, the Services offered by the Company is subject to the terms set forth in our privacy policy located at [totem.org/privacy]({% url 'pages:privacy' %}) (the **"Privacy Policy"**). Our Privacy Policy details how we collect and use your information.

**Changes to the Terms of Use**

We reserve the right to update and revise these Terms at any time. We'll make sure to also change the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page so you can tell if these Terms have changed since your last visit. Any such changes are effective immediately when we post them and apply to all access to and use of the Services thereafter. Please review these Terms regularly because once we post any changes, your continued use of the Services constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.

4.  Your use of the Services does not violate any applicable law or regulation.

To access our Services, you may be required to create a user account (**"Account"**). If you create an Account, you are solely responsible for any activity that occurs through your Account. In order for us to provide you the best possible service, you agree to provide us with complete, accurate, and updated information for your Account at all times. You agree that all information that you submit upon creation of your Account is accurate and truthful and you have the right to post the content on the Service and grant a license to Totem. If any information is incorrect or outdated, it can lead to errors or delays, for which we will not be responsible.

**Governing Law**

No matter where you're located, the laws of the state of Washington will govern these Terms and the relationship between you and the Company as if you signed these Terms in Washington, without regard to New York state's conflicts of laws rules. If any provisions of these Terms are inconsistent with any applicable law, those provisions will be superseded and/or modified only to the extent such provisions are inconsistent.

We take our commitment to customers seriously, and we'll do what we can for you. However, sometimes things may come up that are outside of our control.

You cannot assign, transfer or sublicense these Terms without first obtaining our consent. We may assign, transfer, or delegate any of our rights and obligations without consent. These Terms do not create any agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship, and neither party has any authority to bind the other in any respect.

**Waiver**

If we do not enforce any part of these Terms, it does not mean we give up the right to later enforce that or any other part of these Terms.

**Release**

You release the Company and our successors from all losses, damages, rights, and demands and actions of any kind, including personal injuries, death, and property damage, that are directly or indirectly related to or arise from your use of the Services (collectively, "**Claims**"). If you are a California resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which states, "A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him would have materially affected his settlement with the debtor." This release does not apply to any Claims for unconscionable commercial practice by the Company or fraud, deception, false, promise, misrepresentation or concealment, or suppression or omission of any material fact in connection with the Services.
